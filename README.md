A fully-developed nerd's natural habitat

# Project Description

## What it does
This is the second or third website of this developer, made purely to learn unfamiliar technologies and showing his creative interests.

## Technologies used
Next.js, SCSS, tailwind.css, animate.css, Vercel

## How to deploy
```
npm install

// To view deployment
npm run dev

// To build
npm run build
```
And then deploy it on Vercel

## Challenges and future features
- Adding multiple animations and effect for the user to enjoy made the experience funner, but responsive design more difficult.
- It took the developer 6 months' leave to figure out how to deploy this app to Vercel, which seemed trivial when finally figured out.
- Future features include a functional backend, user authentication, and interactive games as the user goes through the website.
